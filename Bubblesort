'''
Bubble Sort can be implemented as comparing first two terms and picking highest term, afterwards going for next two and comparing them.

##Implementation##



 
def bubble(value):
    for k in range(len(value)):
        for i in range(len(value)-1):
            if value[i]>value[i+1]:
                value[i],value[i+1]=value[i+1],value[i]
        

value=[212,2,343,21,98,121,22,1]
print(bubble(value))
print(value)

Adv:
 Little Memory 
 
Disadv:
 Takes time to sort.
 
Worst and Average Case Time Complexity: O(n*n). Worst case occurs when array is reverse sorted.

Best Case Time Complexity: O(n). Best case occurs when array is already sorted.

Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Boundary Cases: Bubble sort takes minimum time (Order of n) when elements are already sorted.
